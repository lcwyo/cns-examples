### Step Two: Create the Redis master service

A Kubernetes [service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) is a named load balancer that proxies traffic to one or more pods. The services in a Kubernetes cluster are discoverable inside other pods via environment variables or DNS.

Services find the pods to load balance based on pod labels. The pod that you created in Step One has the label `app=redis` and `role=master`. The selector field of the service determines which pods will receive the traffic sent to the service.

1. Use the [redis-master-service.yaml](redis-master-service.yaml) file to create the service in your Kubernetes cluster by running the `kubectl create -f` *`filename`* command:

    ```console
    $ kubectl create -f examples/guestbook-php/redis-master-service.yaml
   
    ```

2. To verify that the redis-master service is up, list the services you created in the cluster with the `kubectl get services` command:

    ```console
    $ kubectl get services
    NAME              CLUSTER_IP       EXTERNAL_IP       PORT(S)       SELECTOR               AGE
    redis-master      10.0.136.3       <none>            6379/TCP      app=redis,role=master  1h
    ...
    ```

    Result: All new pods will see the `redis-master` service running on the host (`$REDIS_MASTER_SERVICE_HOST` environment variable) at port 6379, or running on `redis-master:6379`. After the service is created, the service proxy on each node is configured to set up a proxy on the specified port (in our example, that's port 6379).
