### Step eight: View the guestbook <a id="step-eight"></a>

You can now play with the guestbook that you just created by opening it in a browser (it might take a few moments for the guestbook to come up).

 * **Local Host:**
    If you are running Kubernetes locally, to view the guestbook, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

 * **Remote Host:**
    1. To view the guestbook on a remote host, locate the external IP of the load balancer in the **IP** column of the `kubectl get services` output. In our example, the internal IP address is `10.0.217.218` and the external IP address is `146.148.81.8` (*Note: you might need to scroll to see the IP column*).

    2. Append port `3000` to the IP address (for example `http://146.148.81.8:3000`), and then navigate to that address in your browser.

    Result: The guestbook displays in your browser:
